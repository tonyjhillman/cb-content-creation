Use this template as appropriate, to get started with your new content.

This is a regular paragraph, which starts describing a topic. It introduces a *numbered* list, as follows:

1. This is the first element
2. This is the second element
3. This is the third element

Now we are back to a paragraph again. Now, an **unordered** list:

* The first element
* The second
* The third

Now, a *mixed* list:

1. The first element
2. The second element
  * The first element in an unordered sublist
  * The second
  * The third
3. The third element in the initial, ordered list

## The Second-Level Header

Now, some links:
